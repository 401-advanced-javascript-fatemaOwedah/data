## Implement Graph.
I will write a method that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Big O
- Time o(n^2)  there is for loop inside while loop.
- space o(n) ==> i declare an array ans i push in it.
