## Stacks and Queues
create Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node,Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated this class has a method: push, pop, peek, isEmpty,
Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated this class has this method: enqueue,dequeue,peek, isEmpty.

## Approach & Efficiency
create a class name node and class name Stack inside this class you must add 4 method after you finish test the module.
create class name Queue inside this class you must add 4
